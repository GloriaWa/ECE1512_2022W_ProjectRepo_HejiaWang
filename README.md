Visual Interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks  
  
  

In the Project A folder:  

The notebooks MNIST1D_Gloria.ipynb and HMT_Gloria.ipynb contain the code written for this project.  
  
The training log (if applicable) and all required performance measures are stored in the notebook and in the MNIST1d materials forlder and the HMT materials forlder.  
  
The image outputs are not stored in the notebooks, for the way the code was arranged in the notebooks cannot generate all the images once, and it is not reasonable to only display one output image of all the images used in the report in the notebook. As a result, instead, these image are stroed in the MNIST1D materials forlder and HMT materials forlder.  
  
Please refer to the supporting materals forlder for all other supporting materials used in this project.
