Visual Interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks  
  
  
  
`**In the Project A folder:**  `

* The notebooks MNIST1D_Gloria.ipynb and HMT_Gloria.ipynb contain the code written for this project.  
  
* The training log (if applicable) and all required performance measures are stored in the notebook and in the MNIST1d materials forlder and the HMT materials forlder.  
  
* Note that the result of a tensorboard cannot be stored in the notebook, as a result, please refer to the screenshots in the MNIST1D folder for the accurcy and loss curve in Task 1 Question 3a.
  
* The image outputs are not stored in the notebooks, for the way the code was arranged in the notebooks cannot generate all the output images once. It is not reasonable to display only one output image in the notebook while the writing report used many of them. As a result, instead, please find all output images used in the report in the MNIST1D materials forlder and HMT materials forlder.  
  
* Please refer to the supporting materals forlder for all other supporting materials used in this project.
