**`In the Project A folder:  `**

Project A: Visual Interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks  

* The notebooks MNIST1D_Gloria.ipynb and HMT_Gloria.ipynb contain the code written for this project.  
  
* The training log (if applicable) and all required performance measures are stored in the notebook and in the MNIST1d materials forlder and the HMT materials forlder.  
  
* Note that the result of a tensorboard cannot be stored in the notebook, as a result, please refer to the screenshots in the MNIST1D folder for the accurcy and loss curve in Task 1 Question 3a.
  
* The image outputs are not stored in the notebooks, for the way the code was arranged in the notebooks cannot generate all the output images once. It is not reasonable to display only one output image in the notebook while the writing report used many of them. As a result, instead, please find all output images used in the report in the MNIST1D materials forlder and HMT materials forlder.  
  
* Please refer to the supporting materals forlder for all other supporting materials used in this project.



**`In the Project B folder:  `**

Project B: Knowledge Distillation for Building Lightweight Deep Learning Models in Visual Classification Tasks

* The notebooks Task1.ipynb and Task2.ipynb contain the code written for this project.

* The notebooks Task2_normal_train_for_comparison.ipynb contains the supplementary code written for Task2. This notebook is just for reference and comparison.

* All of the resulting images can be found in the image folder.

* Some of the trained models which are essential to be stored when implementing this project (i.e., the models need a long time to train, let Google Colab automatically store them when training is finished, and reload them for further tasks the next day...) are stored and uploaded to the model folder, for reference.

* Please refer to the submitted report for detailed analysis of this project.
